This is basically just a recolor of clean with some fancy tansition effects thrown in.

To get the same effect as the 'Resonance' logo at the top as with your own custom logo, your logo image with the text needs to be the same height with the logo image (the part that isn't the text) in the same spot. Otherwise it will look silly.

There are no known issues with this theme, but it has not been tested on anything below 2.7.
